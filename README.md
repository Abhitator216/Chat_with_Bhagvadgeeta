# Bhagavad Gita Text Analysis using Pretrained Llama 2 Model

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing the Bhagavad Gita text using the pretrained Llama 2 model. The aim of this project is to leverage advanced natural language processing techniques to gain insights from the sacred Bhagavad Gita text.

## Project Overview

- **Pretrained Llama 2 Model**: We have used the pretrained Llama 2 model, a state-of-the-art language model, to analyze the Bhagavad Gita text. This model has been fine-tuned on a wide range of text data and can provide sophisticated language understanding.

- **Bhagavad Gita Text**: The complete Bhagavad Gita text is included in this repository. This text serves as the input data for our analysis. It is a revered ancient scripture that contains profound teachings and philosophical insights.

- **Hugging Face Model for Embedding**: To generate meaningful embeddings from the Bhagavad Gita text, we utilized a model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. This model transforms the text into numerical vectors, capturing semantic meanings.

- **Pinecone Vector Database**: For efficient storage and retrieval of the generated text embeddings, we integrated the Pinecone vector database. Pinecone enables fast similarity searches and retrieval of semantically similar content, which can aid in addressing various problems.

## Getting Started

To replicate our analysis or use the resources in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

 

2. Explore the Jupyter notebook `Bhagavad_Gita_Analysis.ipynb` to see the step-by-step process of using the Llama 2 model for analyzing the Bhagavad Gita text.

3. If you intend to set up a vector database for the generated embeddings, sign up for a Pinecone account (https://www.pinecone.io/) and follow their instructions to set up your Pinecone environment.

4. Modify and adapt the code to suit your specific use case. You can fine-tune the analysis, experiment with different models, or integrate the embeddings into your applications.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to this project! If you find ways to enhance the analysis, optimize the code, or have ideas for extending the use of Bhagavad Gita text embeddings, feel free to submit a pull request.
